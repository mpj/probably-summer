# Probably Summer

Small test of meteostat bulk api. This is way too ugly to put online, but hey

## Setup

1. Make sure python and pip is installed (since npm postinstall runs `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Open browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`

## Notes
This does not require a meteostat api key, it uses their free bulk download, quite cool.
